So the first week of GSoC '21 has officially passed. Time flies. It was during 18 May to 24 May '21 as mentioned above. So my college exams have finally ended and spent some time chilling!

So we finally bonded with the community and we had an introductory video chat on zoom call. Everyone introduced themselves. Got to know more about the other students in same organization. I gained a lot of exposure through this and understood and faced the hurdles of working with people in different time zones.

Also I spent time fixing the bugs and reading the official documentation for the same. Did study the research papers again (from which the project is meant to be implemented).

So we finally broke then into 6 different chat groups each group associated with one project among the six announced projects.
