Before going through, it is recommended you have knowledge of Monte Carlo Integration process. You can study it from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration#Overview). Also it is recommended that you have gone through the previous post on [Simple MC Integration](/simple-mc-integration/).

## Lovasz Vempala Monte Carlo Integration
Lovasz Vempala Integration Algorithm is used from this [research paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/acg/www/www/papers/integration.pdf). This integration algorithm can be used to integrate logconcave density functions particularly ```g(x)```, which are expressed in the form of ```f(x) = e^g(x)```.
The integration algorithm uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling techniques to run the random walks used for sampling for the Monte Carlo integration path.
