So I was lying in bed after having a tiring day of end-semester exams and watching Big Bang Theory, waiting for 23:30 IST (18:00 UTC) for my acceptance letter. I was feeling a strong chance of 40-60 of getting selected after analyzing my efforts I had invested during the Pre-GSoC time. My heart was beating fast and I slowly became less interested in the sitcom and suddenly my phone pops up a an email notification. Holy moly! **I got accepted into Google Summer of Code '21 for real**.
