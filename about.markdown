Hey folks there!

My name is **Suraj Choubey**. It is the summer of 2021 and I have just finished with my 2nd year at **BITS Pilani Goa**, India focussed in dual degree program i.e. Masters in Mathematics and Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

**I am excited to tell you that I got accepted in Google Summer of Code '21 under GeomScale**. The project title is 'Monte Carlo Integration'. The project involves multidimensional integration for log-concave functions scalable to a few hundred dimensions. This project will bring impact to people mainly in the R&D sector.

This blog posts website is focussed on maintaining weekly logs of my 10 weeks duration at the Google Summer of Code '21 program. Please enjoy reading it through. Have a great day!
